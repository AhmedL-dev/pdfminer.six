Thanks for using pdfminer.six! 

We want to answer your question as quickly and concisely as possible. You can
help by doing a couple of things: 

1. Describe the problem you want to solve. This helps the answerer to understand your context. 
2. If possible, include the problematic document that you are working on. 
3. Share the code that you use. Spend some effort on creating a minimal reproducible example. This makes it easier for others to help you.
